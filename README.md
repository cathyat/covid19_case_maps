# United States Covid-19 Case Maps (2020)
## *Project Introduction*
For this project, 2020 COVID-19 case data across the United States was collected and cleaned to create two interactive web maps:
1. **Choropleth Map**: displays COVID-19 case rates by county using color shading
2. **Proportional Symbol Map**: displays COVID-19 case totals per county using circles scaled by case count
